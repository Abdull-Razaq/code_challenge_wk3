## Brief challenge description
   **Requirements**
For this project, you must:
    Have a well-written README file.
    Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.

   **Project Setup**
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

    Create a new project folder.
    Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PUBLIC)
    Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise we won't steal your code)
    Please make sure you regularly commit to the repository.

  **Core Deliverables**
As a user, I can:

    See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

     See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films` element when the page loads. (_optional_: you can style each film in the list by adding the classes `film item` to each `li` element.) There is a placeholder `li` in the `ul#films` element that is hardcoded in the HTML â€”feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

     Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets available).
